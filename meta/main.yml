      A simple role that updates sources list for debian so, packages are installed
      from stable distribution, while one can install single packages from
      testing.

      1. Jessie is a default distribution
      2. Stretch packages are available, but not installed by default

      Note:

      * As of today this has been tested for 0 production systems, use with care.

      Problems:

      1. For now you need to manually install packages by issuing:

           - name: install foo from testing
             command: aptitude -t {{debian_distros.testing}} install foo
  company: your company (optional)
